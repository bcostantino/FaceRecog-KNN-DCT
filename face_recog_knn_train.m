% function  [trdata_raw,trclass]=face_recog_knn_train(subject_range,dct_coef)
% Name: face_recog_knn_train
% Function: Create a matrix of training vectors from training photos to be 
%       used for KNN recognition
% Input: subject_range - range of faces to be used, maximum is 40. Usually
%                       input as a vector. For example [1 29] means
%                       subjects 1 to 29 inclusive. The first entry must be
%                       a 1.
%       dct_coef - length of the feature DCT vector used for comparison
% Output: 
%       trdata_raw - trainng data of DCT vectors
%       trclass - class labels for each training data vector
% Run: Loop through the user defined number of subjects wanted (defined in
%     the subject range) and create a matrix of length # of subjects x
%     length of DCT (defined by the dct_coef).
% Output file: Mat file that includes the training vectors with 
%       corresponding labels. This file will be used in performance
%       evaluation.
